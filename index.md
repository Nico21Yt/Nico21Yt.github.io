## About Me

Hi! I'm a third year undergraduate student from [School of Mathematics](https://math.tju.edu.cn/), [Tianjin University](https://www.tju.edu.cn/). My **<font color=FireBrick>research interests</font>** primarily focus on computer vision, trustworthy multimodal learning, natural language processing, etc.

Currently I am a research assistant in the MLDM Lab Multimodal Vision Processing (MVP) Group, advised by Dr. [Bing Cao](https://bcaosudo.github.io/), and my research topic is mostly focus on **<font color=FireBrick>trustworthy machine leaning and multimodal fusion with theoretical guarantee</font>**. I will start internship at Computer Science Department, Purdue University, advised by Dr. [Ruqi Zhang](https://ruqizhang.github.io/).

In my spare time, I am very passionate about digital and film photography. In addition to this, I also enjoy making coffee, whether it is hand-poured or espresso. If you share the same interest, I welcome you to exchange ideas with me!
