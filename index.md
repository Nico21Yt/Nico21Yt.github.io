## About Me

Hi! I'm a first year master student from **[School of School of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.gatech.edu/), [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/)**. Before that, I graduated from the **[University of Liverpool](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk)** with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. My research interests primarily focus on **<font color=FireBrick>Multimodal Fusion& Alignment, Trustworthy LLMs, etc</font>**.

I completed my undergraduate thesis and conducted related research on **<font color=FireBrick>alignment in multimodal sentiment analysis</font>** under the supervision of Dr. [Fangyu Wu](https://scholar.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/persons/FangyuWu02). Prior to that, I conducted research on **<font color=FireBrick>multimodal representation learning</font>** under the guidance of Dr. [Lu Zong](https://scholar.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/persons/LuZong) from the Department of Mathematics.

In my spare time, I am very passionate about photography and roadbike cycling. If you share the same interest, I welcome you to exchange ideas with me!

**<font color=FireBrick>I'm looking for longtime research assistant and hope to pursue a PHD position in the fall of '26. If you share the same research interests with me, you are welcome to contact me.</font>**
